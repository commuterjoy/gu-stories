# Problem

We publish articles to the web in the same way that we publish to the
newspaper.  With the exception of live blogs, they are not native to
the web or take advantage of the capabilities that web technologies provide.

But where to start?

Probably from two angles - domain modelling, and UX prototypes.

## Representing stories

- We don't have a domain model for news events and stories, we've just borrowed one
  from a newspaper metaphor ('article', 'frontpage' etc.)
- So, we should write a domain model that represents the content we produce.
- We need to validate the work with the subject area experts - I.e, journalists, editors etc.
- The model should contain other actors involved in the story - places, 
  people, organisations etc.
- Because 'the news' is quite abstract we will probably end up with a few different models
  to experiement with.
- There's a bit of prior art here - BBC, NYTimes, ITV News, flexible content, schema.org
- We should not try to document all domains. Food, money, travel etc. are represented
  differently to news.

## Prototypes

- To date we've published *68* articles tagged with 'newtown-shooting' (in about 4 days).
- I think it's best to take a medium sized story like this, pull it apart, and build some
  prototypes around it.
- We should have in mind what KPIs we want to improve.
- The prototypes should recognise the evolving nature of the story.
- We should look at the stat's, popularity of certain URLs, think about the validity of
  each tag, talk to the people who wrote it etc.
- We should think what different audience segments want to know about the story.
- Nb. There are other types of story to consider - Eg, 'The saga of the Lib/Con coalition', 
  so we should not ignore these.

## Tools

- We are moving from a world of tags to graphs of information so it would be useful to
  explore the workflow & technical implications this during Q4.
- Built in to the prototypes should be an idea of how someone might curate/edit/create
  the information required to power the site, be that Flexible Content or otherwise.
- We should evaluate need for hand-cranked tags in the context of having a domain model.

## Overlap with personalisation/data work

- The 'intelligence' behind the data work is about spotting usage patterns from URLs
  being visited.
- The clearer our understanding about the URLs being viewed, the better the
  intelligence. Tags tell us a bit, but not much. The domain model should increase 
  the _system's_ understanding of our content.
- With the audience segments we can also expose different parts of the domain to
  different types of people, Eg. people with detailed understanding of a story Vs. people
  who are new to the story.

## External facing

- With a domain that describes events we can interlink with other organisations easily.
- Eg, if BBC and Guardian used the same events to describe their content it would be
  trivial for each other to aggregate relevant links, content etc.
- Eg, Google News - I think there's some advantages to be gained from talking to 
  them about our model of news events - I.e. being more helpful to our largest referer, and 
  Gingras is mad for this stuff, and leading the inveitable move from tags to
  semantics.
